# Modeling Counterpoint in Froglet

### Project Objective

In addition to melody, rhythm, and harmony, one other important element of music is counterpoint. Counterpoint is the juxtaposition of multiple musical lines which sound distinct yet harmonious. It's usually taught using a *cantus firmus* line, which is like a main melody, and another *counterpoint* line that complements the cantus firmus and belongs to one of four different *species*. In this project, we model cantus firmi, which are required to follow a set of restrictive rules. These rules are already complex to model, so we decided not to model counterpoint. However, modeling first species counterpoint could be a good way to extend this project.
