# Modeling Counterpoint in Froglet

### Project Objective

In addition to melody, rhythm, and harmony, one other important element of music is counterpoint. Counterpoint is the juxtaposition of multiple musical lines which sound distinct yet harmonious. It's usually taught using a *cantus firmus* line, which is like a main melody, and another *counterpoint* line that complements the cantus firmus and belongs to one of four different *species*. In this project, we model both cantus firmi and first species counterpoint, which are each required to follow a set of restrictive rules.
